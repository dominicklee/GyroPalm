This directory hosts official Arduino 1.0.5 distribution libs patched for mighty-1284p core compatibility. If/when these libs become mighty-1284p core compatible in a future official 1.x distribution, they can be removed from this directory.

The recommended installation for these patched libs is under the user's sketches/libraries folder, so as to not require disturbing the original distribution files, but installing these as the alternative default libs.
